The exact solution depends on the specific cause of the build failure. There isn't a single fix for all cases.  Strategies to investigate and resolve this issue involve:

1. **Clean Build:** Always start by cleaning your project and performing a fresh build: 
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo build:android
```
2. **Check Logs:** Examine the complete Expo CLI logs carefully. There might be more specific error messages hidden deeper within the output that provide clues to the problem.
3. **Dependency Conflicts:** Analyze your `package.json` file. Resolve any potentially conflicting package versions. Consider using tools like `npm-check-updates` to check for outdated dependencies and upgrade them to stable versions.
4. **Android Environment:** Ensure your Android development environment is correctly configured with the Android SDK, NDK, and necessary build tools. Verify that the correct paths are set in your system's environment variables. 
5. **Gradle:**  If the issue relates to Gradle, you might need to adjust Gradle settings in your project's `android` directory. This could involve modifying build scripts or changing Gradle versions. Ensure your Gradle version is compatible with Expo's requirements.
6. **SDK and NDK Versions:** In some cases, using specific SDK or NDK versions can resolve certain build issues. Consult Expo's official documentation to identify recommended versions.
7. **Community Support:** Check the Expo community forums, Stack Overflow, or the Expo GitHub repository for similar reported problems.  Others may have faced similar issues and found solutions.
8. **Reproducible Example:** If you can't find a solution, create a minimal, reproducible example that isolates the problem and share it in an issue report with the Expo team or community forums.  Providing a minimal project makes it much easier to diagnose and solve the problem.
